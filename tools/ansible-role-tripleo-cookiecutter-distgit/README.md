# ansible-role-tripleo-cookiecutter

Cookiecutter template for a compliant OpenStack TripleO Ansible role distgit

## Installation

Install [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/) either from source, pip or package if it exists

## Usage

There are two ways to create the boilerplate for the ansible role.

### Locally

  1. Clone locally the [ansible-role-tripleo-cookiecutter-distgit](https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/ansible-role-tripleo-cookiecutter-distgit/) repository.
  2. Run `cookiecutter /path/to/cloned/repo`

### Remotely (ie. using a git repo)

  1. Run `cookiecutter https://git.openstack.org/openstack/ansible-role-tripleo-cookiecutter-distgit.git`

## What's next

Once the distgit is ready, make the proper patch to [rdoproject](https://www.rdoproject.org/documentation/add-packages/) and wait for the reviews to do the rest.
